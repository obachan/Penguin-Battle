I began with the MinimumOgre framework taken from the Ogre Wiki.
Then I removed the Ogrehead that was originally in the file and added a sphere at (0,0,0) using the sphere mesh that was originally included in the Sample folder.
To create the box surrounding the sphere, I used 6 planes.
In order to make the ball move I generated a random velocity vector and once the ball hit the wall the velocity vector was reflected across the normal of the plane that the ball hit.

Extra Features:
I also added texture to the walls of the box and also to the ball.
In addition to the different textures, I also colored the ball a metallic grey and a plastic blue color.
Every time the ball hits a wall and bounces off, the color/texture of the ball changes.
